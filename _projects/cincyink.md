ArtWorks commissioned Chase Public to write a love letter to Cincinnati in the form of a poem for The Cincinnati Tattoo Project. I was one of three lead poets who co-wrote and edited the poem.

We began by writing individually, exploring our personal relationships with Cincinnati and the ideas and forms of love letters. Next, we asked people who call Cincinnati home what they love about Cincinnati. For each person who shared, we wrote poems that reflected on the stories they told us--a process we call Short Order Poetry--at public events including the MidPoint Music Festival and Lumenocity. Working this way, we wrote several hundred poems for people.

ArtWorks created postcards and asked people to write and draw what they love about Cincinnati. Scott Holzman and I read them, several hundred in all, and sorted them by theme.  Chase Public hosted several poet get-togethers where writers pulled out favorite lines and ideas and wrote responses to what they'd read.

With all of this material in hand, I sat down with Mike Fleisch and Scott to write the poem. Our work process was to work in Google Documents, where we could all write together. By working in the same document, we could assemble several versions of a single stanza or section and see each other's work.

As we wrote, there were lots of discussions about big ideas and individual word and punctuation choices. We read the poem out loud again and again, advocating and defending various decisions. The words that remain truly represent our three voices.

After contributing about 100 hours to the project, the poem was complete. Read about what happened next at ArtWorks's website.

I'm proud of the CincyInk poem and the work we did. It's a poem that belongs to all of us&mdash;the three lead writers, all the other Short Order poets and writers who worked with us, and the city of Cincinnati.
