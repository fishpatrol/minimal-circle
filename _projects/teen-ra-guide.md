The SWON Library Consortium hosts a free reading challenge for librarians each year. It's a chance for librarians who serve teen patrons to read new and old books to find titles their teens might enjoy. Being part of the challenge helps them share book recommendations and reviews with other librarians, too.

We wanted to share the reviews, but sending around a big Excel file was not what anyone wanted. In 2013, one of the years I ran the challenge, we decided to try something new: to make a book out of their reviews.

Teams of librarians posted their books and reviews to a website called [LibraryThing](http://librarything.com), where you look up books and add them to your virtual collection. At the end of the challenge, I exported data from the teams in CSV format, then brought the data into Excel. I sorted the books by author and title. Other fields had information like the year of publication and the book's ISBN number. Librarians added star ratings, reviews, and category tags.

I built formulas, at the end of these rows, to put all the data into one cell and format it so that it would be ready to use in Adobe InDesign. Sometimes several people wrote reviews about the same book. So the formulas included logic that would only include the book's title and other information if that row held the first review for a book. 

In InDesign, I created styles for different kinds of text: book titles, team titles, star ratings and review text. I used InDesign's find-and-replace feature to find text and apply a style to it. That way I could style most of the book automatically. Formulas in Excel added characters I would replace with carriage returns or special characters, too.

After completing the find-and-replace searches, I indexed the authors and category tags the librarians had added. Finally, I balanced pages so that reviews weren't awkwardly broken (for example, with the book title on one page and the author's name on the next. It took a lot of work, but I'm proud of the result.
