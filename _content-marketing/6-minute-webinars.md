#### The Gift

For a surprising variety of topics, YouTube is a great source for online training. Technology is certainly well-represented. Take the Cameo Silhouette, which Valerie Davis shared at this week's Staff Training Symposium. On YouTube, you can find [tutorials from the manufacturer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plkDOaH2JEI) and lots of [how-to videos from individuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs1HJOCHwO4).

Watch videos for the UP Plus 2 3D printer (which you can borrow from SWON), including [setup instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpatyPvD5oU) and print demonstrations. This video of a [printed gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G28tW4XSN8) is in Japanese, but it's easy to follow what he's doing. Or here's a video of [printing with flexible nylon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RevV4VgJkM), a material I hadn't seen used before.

Seeing a project in action isn't only good for learning how something's done. It can also give you a sense of the degree of difficulty involved. Last summer I put on brushbot programs at several public libraries. Here are [a few brushbots in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NokyDwFIfOE), including instructions and a fun DIY variation using a plastic cup instead of a toothbrush. It looks pretty simple, and it is.

This year we have Makey Makey kits to lend out. Explaining what Makey Makey is can be a challenge. It's probably much easier if you watch their [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNLHYRbR07s). Their website lists [a variety of cool projects](http://www.makeymakey.com/guides/) which include PDF instructions. But from watching a video, it's a lot easier to understand what it would take to [make your own version of the game Operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KEEqZgFVsg).

There's plenty of need for more formal training. But YouTube is great for times when you have *what is it?* questions or want to see what others people are creating (or at least attempting).


#### The Pitch
