This is a talk I gave to a group of about 70 librarians and library support staff on how to offer basic tech support. Tap on the pictures to read brief explanations about each slide. Below the slides is the text from the handout I made to accompany the talk.

# Technology Triage Handout

Can you remember the last time you needed customer support *and got it?* They fixed your account or took your return with no hassles? It's fantastic! Even if that's the way you expected it to go, it's still fantastic. You were probably so impressed that you told someone.

A tech support request is a customer service request. Everyone's had their share of computer problems. I know I have. When something isn't working, it's frustrating, and a tech support request often comes from someone who's day has just gotten worse. So be on their side and help them as best you can. They'll thank you for it.

## How to Take a Tech Support Request
1.	"Oh no! I’m sorry it isn’t working." (i.e. “I believe you.”)
1.	"What’s happening? Show me." 
	+ It's okay if you they tell you a story.
	+ You're likely hear what they're trying to do, how they went about doing it, what went wrong, and *why* they think it went wrong.
	+ The "what" is most important, followed by the "how."
1. Resist the impulse to diagnose/prescribe before seeing the problem.
	+ Their guess at "why" is just that: a guess. 
	+ Don't join them in guessing.
	+ You want to follow the facts; get to the machine to find the facts. 
1. Let them "drive" before you "drive."
1. **Aim for successfully completing the task. Hope for a fix.**

## Ways to Make a List
Whether mental or written down, a list can help you think of things to check or ways to rule out what's working and focus on what doesn't work. The more lists you make, the easier it will be to create lists and recognize where things often go wrong. 

1.	What do you see? 
	+ Error message?
		+ Often describes what system has the problem.
		+ Often includes a code or instructions.
		+ **You can always google the message or code.**
	+ Library computer/system or personal computer/system?
		+ Likely to have different problems.
		+ Can provide more support for library systems than personal systems. Either way, don't give up!
	+ What program are they running or trying to run? (Printers count!)
1.	Look for the chain.
	+ How are things connected? (Physically or networked)
	+ Laptop &rarr; USB port &rarr; Camera
	+ Laptop & Web Browser &rarr; WiFi &rarr; Library Internet Connection &rarr; Website
	+ **Test each link you can.** Different USB cable? Different computer? Different web browser? 
1. **Test, test, test.**
1.	Ask questions, especially if it's an unfamiliar system.
	+ What do they usually see? How does it usually work?
	+ Gives you more information to use (adds links to the chain).
	+ Gives the person opportunity to explain more.
1. **Have you tried turning it off and back on?**
1. Make the next call.
	+ If you still haven't found a solution, make a list of what you know. 
	+ Also list what you've tried, switched off/on.
	+ Use this info when placing a tech support call (by you or the patron, as appropriate).
