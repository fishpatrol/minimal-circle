    title: "Ebooks have two basic formats. First, Adobe's PDF. It stores the math of letter shapes, so pages always look like the publisher designed them to look. Make a PDF window larger and the entire text gets larger."

    title: "The other format is EPUB (it's the basis of Amazon's MOBI format). It's a package of text files. If you need larger print, you can change the font size and it will fit on your screen. No scrolling back and forth like you would have to with a PDF."

    title: "eInk devices have pros and cons. Their batteries can last for a month of regular use. Most aren't backlit, or you can turn the backlight off, so they look more like paper. And they're pretty inexpensive. But the screen flashes with almost every change on the page, which is annoying. They also only work with a limited set of ebook formats/sources."

    title: "If reading ebooks is your interest, Android and Apple's iOS are really on par. But you probably want a device that runs the same system as your smartphone, for ease of use (and so you aren't buying apps twice). Though on the other hand, the Nvidia starts at $200, while the iPad Air 2 starts at $400."

    title: "Publishers try to make ebook lending difficult, by making users jump through hoops, charging much more for ebook titles than physical copies, and in some cases making library ebooks wear out (expire) after a certain number of checkouts. Libraries are trying to make it easier, by adding ebooks to their online catalogs so you can find ebook and print editions of a book in the same place. Reading ebooks isn't as easy as it could be or (arguably) should be."

# Ebooks and E-Readers in 2016

The ebook/e-reader landscape hasn't changed much since I created the first version of this slide deck back in 2011. That's bad news for library patrons, since the ebook checkout process has always been hostile.

The first wide-spread ebook checkout system in public libraries came from Overdrive. Ebook files included digital rights management so that libraries can't check out more copies of an ebook than a library has bought. Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) was their DRM provider. If you tried to download an ebook, then set up ADE to load the book on your advice, it wouldn't work. 

It's hard to know how much of this difficulty was intentional. Publishers were very worried about ebooks cutting into their hardcopy sales, and public libraries are their largest market. So publishers have used various tactics to increase ebook profits, like charging much more for ebook versions than print versions. When Overdrive first added Kindle compatibility, they forced Kindle users to load books by USB, blocking WiFi downloading. They wanted it to be more difficult, to push people to buy their own copy instead.

High costs and expensive vendor systems with restrictive DRM have, I think, braked what could have been a great rush of ebook reading. Many public libraries have contracts with multiple ebook and audiobook vendors, including Hoopla and OneClickDigital. Some let you download titles to a computer; some restrict you to their app, and whatever features it includes or lacks. Publishers and vendors make lots of money off this fragmentation.

This added friction is a barrier for groups who could greatly benefit from ebook access. For elderly readers, being able to create a large print edition with the click of a few buttons is a great service. But requiring multiple systems and accounts is a high hurdle for patrons who don't have a home computer. And Adobe Digital Editions authenticates the entire computer, so libraries can't have a computer available for patrons to load ebooks onto their devices.

Libraries have won the ability to include digital titles in their online catalogs. Instead of searching each vendor's website for a title, you can search in one place. But patrons still have to figure out what to do with results that read, "Place Hold with Overdrive" or "Instantly available on hoopla." 

Many patrons do figure it out. At the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, at least, ebook checkouts keep rising and rising. I don't expect the landscape to change until the top publishers take a different attitude toward ebook lending, and I don't expect that any time soon.
