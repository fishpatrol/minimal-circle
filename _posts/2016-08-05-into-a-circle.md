At the MidPoint Music Festival in 2013, I was sitting in the open back of a box truck, writing poems for strangers. 

This was part of a Chase Public project called Short Order Poetry. For it, we invite people passing by to let us write their poem for them. We ask them to tell us what they would like a poem written about, and in a 5-10 minute interview, we write down ideas and quotes from whatever they've chosen. After that conversation, we sit down at manual typewriters and write a poem for them in about 15 minutes. We keep a carbon copy for our records, but we give them the original, for free.

I love this work. The topics people choose are surprising in their range and intimacy. I've written poems for kids who love baseball, who have lost a pet, who want a wheelchair that can fly, who love peaches. I've written poems for adults who are mourning the loss of a loved one, who on their way to a first date, who are about to send a child to college. I love asking strangers this open-ended question and hearing them respond.

I love writing their poems. From an interview, I usually take a full page of notes. The work is in finding a lens through which to write about what they've shared. Without an angle, the poem can easily turn into simple rearrangement. And rearrangement can be artfully done. I like asking, what can be said, or how can I say something, that's different from what's already been said.

The time limit is the flame under the crucible. Sit at the typewriter. Read through the notes you took. Remember the person's face, how they told the story, what was told and what was not. Come up with a title. Type it. Type the first line, too late now, follow the thread. Choose, choose. Then choose to stop. The typewriter won't let you change your mind. You can't try a few things out. Pick words, and find a way to use them. This is the fastest route to a flow state that I've experienced.

Back to the festival and 2013. I interviewed a University of Cincinnati student who was studying in DAAP. City planning? Architecture? I don't remember. The poem is pretty cryptic now, but then it was never for me. I just know it's the poem where I first used "into a circle."
